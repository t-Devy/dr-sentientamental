# Project Description

This is a sentiment analysis build in the preliminary phase of structuring 
data. To start out I have focused on internalizing a synthetic data
generation pipeline simply for programmatic exercise while I wait 
for approvals from various social media outlets to gain access to real data. 

The pipeline will use HDBSCAN procedures to generate labels based on incoming
data, and then train a classifier that gauges sentiment analysis associated
with the derived theme/label.
